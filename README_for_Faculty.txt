
Sensor Lab Training GUI – Launch Instructions

Thank you for using the Sensor Lab Dashboard powered by Moku:Go and Python.

How to Launch:
1. Double-click "launch_sensorlab.bat"
2. The GUI will open in your default web browser
3. Select the experiment and enter the Moku:Go IP address
4. Click "Start Experiment" to begin

Requirements:
• Python 3.11 installed
• Internet connection (optional if modules access online resources)
• All files must remain in this folder structure

Troubleshooting:
If you see a warning about session state or bare mode, it is safe to ignore.
If an experiment module does not run, ensure Moku:Go is connected and reachable.
