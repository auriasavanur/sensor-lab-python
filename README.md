# Sensor Lab Experiments with Moku:Go and Python

This repository contains Python scripts for simulating and visualizing sensor data using Moku:Go in a faculty training context.

## ðŸ“˜ Experiments Included

- **RTD / Thermistor Calibration** â€“ `rtd_live.py`
- **Strain Gauge Bridge Output** â€“ `strain_live.py`
- **LVDT Displacement Simulation** â€“ `lvdt_plot.py`
- **Pulse Sensor Visualization** â€“ `pulse_sensor_live.py`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP file.
2. Ensure Moku:Go is powered on and connected to your network.
3. Install Python â‰¥3.8 and required libraries (`matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `zeroconf`, `moku`)
4. Run any script using `python scriptname.py`

## ðŸ§ª Dependencies

- `moku`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `zeroconf`

Install them using:
```bash
pip install moku matplotlib numpy scipy zeroconf


## ðŸŽ“ Use Case
These scripts were developed for faculty workshops and hands-on engineering education using Moku:Go.
## ðŸ“² QR Code Access
Each script is linked via QR code in the training manual. Faculty can scan to view, copy, or run code directly.
